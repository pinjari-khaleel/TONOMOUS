      topics of conversation. These criteria should be adhered to whether the content is abstract,
      metaphorical, portraiture, corporate or lifestyle.<br><br>If your selection answers these
      questions, you have found an image thatâ€™s right for NEOM:</p>'

items:
  - '<p>Does the photo feel aspirational?</p>'
  - '<p>Does it feel remarkable?</p>'
